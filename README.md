# biological-sequence-file-format
Biological sequence files have 2 types of format:
- Simple (eg., FASTA, RAW and GCG)
- Rich (eg., Genbank, EMBL, Swissprot and GenPept)

Using C++ and object-oriented programming (OOP) style, a program is developed to store and display biological sequence according to user's choice of file format.
User can choose between ‘Simple format’, ‘Rich format’ or ‘Both formats’. User also need to enter some necessary and optional details.
